# ECDSA-Vulnerabilities

## Overview
This project focuses on the vulnerabilities present in the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is commonly used for securing transactions and ensuring authenticity. It delves into the weaknesses of ECDSA and explores potential attack vectors that can compromise the integrity of systems relying on this algorithm.

## File Content
- **ECDSA_vulnerabilities.pdf**: A comprehensive research paper detailing the vulnerabilities in the ECDSA algorithm, analyzing potential attacks and weaknesses, and suggesting mitigation strategies.

## Topics Covered
- Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
- ECDSA algorithm overview
- Vulnerabilities and generic attacks (e.g., Pohlig-Hellman Attack)
- Case studies and practical implications

Feel free to explore the file to understand the risks associated with ECDSA and the measures that can be taken to secure systems using this algorithm.
